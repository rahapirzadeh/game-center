### Hangman
Two players are able to
* Play through multiple rounds
* Receive game statistics
* Gain points for correct guesses


## First Sprint
Hangman introduces the game to the user, selects a random word or phrase from a text file of technology-related buzz words, converts it to underscores and whitespace, and prompts the user to guess.
Checks for incorrect inputs.
## Second Sprint
Networking portion of game is coming together and Hangman implements the new methods.
Most of networking code is written with some minor bugs.
Dockerfile is written.
