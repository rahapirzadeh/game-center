Raha: Rock, Paper, Scissors code is playable. Next sprint will include networking features

Jonathan: Right now, tik tac toe displays the board, and allows player input. Next sprint will include working win conditions and proper networking features

Brandon: Currently, Hangman introduces the game to the user, selects a random word or phrase from a text file of technology-related buzz words, converts it to underscores and whitespace, and prompts the user to guess. Next sprint should allow user to enter single and multiple guesses, give up, and win the game.
